Overview: Interfacing a DHT Sensor with Arduino Using Tinkercad

Objective
To measure temperature and humidity using a Temperature sensor and display the readings on a 16x2 LCD using Arduino, simulated in Tinkercad.

Components Needed
Arduino Uno
temperature Sensor
16x2 LCD Screen
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
10 Î© Resistor
potentiometer

Set Up Components in Tinkercad:
Add Arduino Uno, temperature sensor, 16x2 LCD, and breadboard.

Connect VCC and GND of temperature to 5V and GND on Arduino.
Connect Vout pin to A0 pin of Arduino 

Connect LCD:
Connect VCC to 5V and GND to GND.
Connect V0  pin to wiper of potentiometer
connect the DB4 to DB7 to arduino pin 
connect R5 TO  pin 8 of arduino
connect RW to gnd
connect E to pin 8

Write Code:

Upload the code in Tinkercad.
upload the code given in my file and simulate
